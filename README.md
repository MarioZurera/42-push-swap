# 42 Push Swap

Those projects are part of 42, the usage of this repo without truly understanding it is not recommended, I invite you to compare your code.  

- I'd like to include that copying will make your programming experience harder due to the lack of problem solving skills.
- If you are a part of the 42 staff, contact me before taking any kind of actions.
- In case you are not part of the 42 community you are free to get ideas, analyze or learn anything new from those projects.

If you want to discuss something about the code, below are some ways of communications:
